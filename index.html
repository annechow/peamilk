<p>The coffee shop is rustic, the kind of hippie environment that Erica likes—although Hanna
knows she would never admit it. The menu is hand-written on a chalkboard in a garish white cursive,
with purple and pink floral symbols dotted around the perimeter. When Hanna used to go with Eri,
she would just get whatever she ordered. Eri knew the menu much better than she did. Now, however,
Hanna stares at the chalk, blinking at the options staring back at her.</p>

<p>"What can I get you, ma'am?" the cashier asks. Hanna hadn't realized she'd reached the front of
the line, and she still doesn't know what to get.</p>

<p>"Um," she says.</p>

<p>"Take your time!” The cashier flashes a bright smile. She looks like she just got out of high
school. Before Hanna's eyes return to the listings of coffee, they catch briefly on the cashier's hair: pink
and purple strands peek out from the dirty blonde, reminiscent of the girls Hanna used to pine for
when she was sixteen. But if Eri were here, Hanna wouldn't even be thinking about that.</p>

<p>God, she is so out of her element. What is the difference between cortado and macchiato again?
Why are there so many options for milk substitutions?</p>

<p>"I'll have a regular black coffee," she says.</p>

<br><hr><br>

<p>Chicago is a big city, and it's cold. Hanna doesn't like cities. Nor does she like the cold. She was raised in Tempe, and her comfort weather is 80 degrees.</p>
<p>When Eri flew into her room, screaming and waving her UChicago grad school acceptance
letter, Hanna was so proud of her. At least, she thought she was. She tried so very hard to be. But there
was a small lump in her heart, and it reminded her of the same way one feels when a popcorn kernel is
stuck between their back teeth: nobody else sees it, nobody else knows it’s there except for you. And
you can ignore it, for a little bit. But leave it there unchecked and slowly it drives you insane until you
can't think about anything else but this tiny little piece wedged in your mouth.</p>

<p>That's how Hanna felt, when Eri waved her letter and held her arms open for Hanna to hug
her. She squeezed so tight that eventually she couldn't tell if her squealing was still from excitement or
playful protest at how hard Hanna was hugging her.</p>

<p>That was one year ago, and by now the memories have faded enough that all Hanna remembers
is how wide Eri's smile was. And the way Eri's happiness made her realize she could identify the kernel
of corn: it was resentment that she could be so happy to leave her.</p>

<br><hr><br>

<p>As she waits for her black coffee, Hanna remembers the first time she came here with Erica.
<i>Almond milk and soy milk are acceptable.</i> She had been reading the menu out loud, while Eri linked
her arm through Hanna's and rested her chin on her shoulder. <i>Oat milk though? Oat milk is pushing it.</i></p>

<p><i>Come on,</i> said Erica. <i>Oat milk tastes like bread, it's great.</i></p>

<p><i>Okay, what about pea milk? What the fuck is pea milk?</i></p>

<p>They looked at each other, then collapsed into giggles at the idea of milking peas.</p>

<br><hr><br>
<p>The University of Arizona had 35,000 undergraduate students. Out of all those thousands of
people, it was Erica who occupied the dorm room next to Hanna's. They met about two months into
freshman year. It was the weekend; Hanna remembers that, because her roommate was out of town,
visiting her parents. A knock came at the door, interrupting Hanna’s half-hearted studying. Pushing
her textbook away, Hanna slipped her feet into her purple fuzzy bunny slippers and trudged towards
the door.</p>

<p>Typically she would have looked through the small circular viewer before opening the door,
but this time—maybe her brain was addled after four hours of studying—she unlocked it without
question. She thought it might be the R.A, coming for a routine inspection. Or perhaps her roommate,
back early for whatever reason.</p>

<p>She was, therefore, wholly unprepared for the stranger she saw when she opened the door: a
girl, small, Asian, wearing a baggy grey-blue sweatshirt with pink Nike shorts and mismatched neon
socks.</p>

<p><i>Hi,</i> said Hanna.</p>

<p><i>Wow,</i> said the stranger. <i>I love your slippers.</i></p>

<p><i>Oh.</i> Hanna looked down and wiggled her toes. <i>Um. Thanks.</i></p>

<p>It turned out that the stranger's name was Erica, and she hated to bother Hanna at this time of
night, but please oh please could she use her bathroom? Her roommate was occupying hers, because
she had gone out for happy hour and then went to a friend's place afterwards and now she was throwing up
in the bathtub, and technically Erica could still go while she was in there but she really didn't want to, because that is not only kind of gross but also feels like an invasion of privacy, and at some point Hanna had opened the door wider and ushered her in the direction of their bathroom before really processing what was happening.</p>
<p>She waited at her desk, awkwardly, staring at the textbook blankly until she heard the toilet
flush and the bathroom door open.</p>

<p><i>Thank you so much, you've a lifesaver.</i></p>

<p>Hanna laughed at that.</p>

<p><i>Where's your roommate?</i> asked Erica. She lingered by the bathroom.</p>

<p><i>In Phoenix,</i> replied Hanna. She wondered briefly why Erica wasn't leaving.</p>

<p><i>Lucky her.</i> She walked over to Hanna's desk, then, and the thought fluttered away like a
butterfly. <i>Is that bio? Are you a bio major?</i></p>

<p><i>No, I just need the science credit. I'm an art major.</i> Hanna gestured vaguely at the scattered sketchbooks
on the nightstand next to her bed, the pencils and charcoal littering table and floor. <i>A messy one.</i></p>

<p><i>Art! That's so cool. I'm just a psych major. What classes are you taking?</i></p>

<p>Apparently, they were in the same communications class. They made plans to study together
for the test next week.</p>

<p>Hanna had never been a hugger, but she didn't protest when Erica hugged her before leaving. The grey-blue sweatshirt was soft, like cotton candy.</p>

<br><hr><br>

<p>The coffee tastes nice. Hanna never really knows the difference between bad coffee and good
coffee, and so she can't be a judge of whether this is truly good coffee or not. But it isn't too watery and
it warms her insides. She cups the mug with her hands, breathing in deeply.</p>

<p>The heat is welcome. Chicago is cold, after all.</p>

<br><hr><br>
      
<p>The Call came while Hanna was visiting, three months ago. She had taken the bus into the city
while Erica worked. Maybe she would pick up some hot dogs for lunch, she thought, then her cell
phone buzzed.</p>

<p>She had to ask her mother to repeat it twice, because she couldn't hear or process what she was
saying, and then when she heard the words a third time she literally collapsed onto a bench and a
passing stranger asked if she was okay.</p>

<p>Yes, I'm fine, said Hanna as she tried to breathe normally. Then she immediately dialed Erica
and said please, Eri, please come home, I need you, and Erica said what's wrong, and Hanna said please
I will tell you later I am coming back and I need you right now.</p>

<p>Erica was there when Hanna opened the door, and when she asked what was wrong, concern
was etched so deep, all over her normally carefree face. Hanna thought about how much she loved her
and then considered very slowly what the best choice of words would be before saying Eri, my dad is
dead.</p>

<p>There was a silence and the words hung in the air after they left her mouth, spinning around.
Hanna watched them and felt dizzy. She needed to sit down. She sat down on the couch and her fingers
grasped the plaid blue blanket spread over the cushions, working themselves into the cloth like ocean
waves, rolling in and out and in and out.</p>

<p>Hanna became vaguely aware of Erica talking, now, asking a bunch of questions: how did it
happen? How did you find out? Is your family alright? And Hanna concentrated very hard before answering in minimal words, it was a car crash, my mom called me, and they're fine, I think.</p>
<p>Erica continued to talk. The words formed a stream that flowed over Hanna's head down her
shoulders and formed a little pool in her lap, and she stared at it and did not recognize her reflection at
all. She felt only a vague annoyance. It was how Erica processed things, Hanna reminded herself—by
talking—things like when she found out her aunt had cancer or when she got a failing grade on her
history midterm. Things like grief.</p>

<p>Hanna watched her watching herself. She couldn't speak anymore, couldn't form words.</p>

<p>What happened, where was the crash? Were there other people involved? Your poor mother,
my God, are you going back to Tempe, they have to let you take off school for this. Oh Han, it will be
okay, I'm so sorry, have you talked to your brother yet?</p>

<p>Is this what being on ketamine feels like, thought Hanna, watching her reflection drown.</p>

<br><hr><br>

<p>The first time they slept together, it was in the shitty twin bed of a UA dorm room. It was
Hanna's first time with a girl; only Erica knew what she was doing, and she was very good at it. In the
middle of the sex, Hanna blurted out that she loved her, and they had to stop so Erica could kiss away
the embarrassment into a mess of giggles. Eventually they fell asleep, facing each other in a tangled mess
of limbs and hair and feelings. A week later they were dating.</p>

<br><hr><br>

<p>There's a clump of tiny bells at the top of the coffee shop door; they jingle whenever anyone
enters. When the chimes sound, Hanna nearly lets them fade into the background, only glancing up
out of habit. But she does glance up. And it's suddenly so hard to take her eyes off this couple, something so mesmerizing about the way he looks down at her, she clutches onto his hand.</p>
<p>Hanna watches as they order, then sit at the table next to her. They have a cute height
difference; even sitting down, her head barely reaches high enough for her to lean on his shoulder. She
talks animatedly, the way Erica does. He listens and laughs, asking follow-up questions and smiling the
way Hanna can't anymore. They're so in love. Hanna is enthralled by how in love they are.</p>

<p>She sips her coffee and feels nauseous.</p>

<p>It was Erica who voiced the need for a break, but Hanna knew she had also wanted one. It was
beginning to be difficult, every time she visited, every time they were on the phone.</p>

<p><i>You're so distant,</i> Erica had said. <i>I feel like you don't like me anymore. I feel like I'm not
interesting anymore.</i></p>

<p>Hanna listened to her tiny girlfriend's tear-choked voice coming through the headphones and
wished half-heartedly that she could feel something, anything at all. It was not true that she didn’t like
her anymore or that she didn’t find her interesting. But it was true that Hanna was distant.</p>

<p>She discovered the month after her dad's death that it was easier, somehow, to detach from
things. Easier than caring. Before, she spent a lot of time and effort caring. Erica kept asking questions
that Hanna didn’t want to answer, didn't want to think about—questions like <i>how are you doing, how
are you feeling</i>—and soon it became easier to come up with evasive answers, to pretend she was happy
or angry or anything other than sad, until finally Erica began noticing that something was wrong and
yet Hanna <i>still wouldnt tell her, after all of this?</i></p>

<p>The truth was that Hanna wasn't sure what to tell. She had faded away into a cardboard cutout of a person, and the slightest breeze could blow her down. But at the same time, Erica was the only force with any hope of grounding her. She had been there for four and a half years, Hanna didn’t want to let her go. But it wasn't up to her.</p>

<p><i>We should probably take a break,</i> the cardboard cutout agreed. <i>I don't want to hurt you
anymore.</i></p>

<p>Erica was silent, for once, and Hanna felt a hint, a sliver, of some emotion. She didn't know
what it was. She pushed it away. Eri was hurting because of her, so this was the best choice.</p>

<p>Eventually Erica spoke: <i>Two weeks? No contact.</i></p>

<p><i>Two weeks,</i> agreed Hanna.</p>

<p>Another silence.</p>

<p><i>I'll come see you afterwards,</i> Hanna added as an afterthought. It felt like the right thing to say.</p>

<br><hr><br>

<p>Erica always knew what she wanted, and it was one of the qualities that drew Hanna to her so
strongly. Even as a freshman, she had a six-year plan. Hanna chose to be an art major because her
parents had put her in art classes as a child, and she never stopped painting since then. After they
graduated together, Hanna found herself left behind—with no job, no Erica, and no structure.</p>

<p>Is she passionate about art? Sure. She enjoys it. She's good at it. There is a certain peace in the
way it feels to outline a pencil sketch with ink. There is comfort in the certainty that comes with filling
in empty spaces with colors that she knows will blend well together, familiar ratios burned into her
brain, the same paint stains on her fingers after years of practice and experience. There was a period of her life where she couldn't imagine doing anything else, when new paints and charcoals excited her, when she couldn't wait to dash colors over a page of white. For a short while, she lived to recreate the
beauty of a landscape or a dream.</p>

<p>She is good at rendering the likeness of things. But what kind of future is it to imitate?</p>

<br><hr><br>

<p>On Hanna's phone is a text, one she received yesterday. She was packing when the alert chimed,
the first time Erica had texted her for two weeks.</p>

<p><i>I still want you,</i> it read.</p>

<p>It was unlike Erica to send something so short. Hanna still hasn't replied.</p>

<br><hr><br>

<p>Hanna had never dated anyone before Erica. It was never an issue for her, but other people
would be surprised when she told them that the first relationship she's ever been in has lasted four years
and counting, and it made her feel like maybe she should be concerned, a little bit.</p>

<p>Her mother wasn't homophobic, but that didn’t mean that it was pleasant to tell her about
Erica. <i>Are you sure about this?</i> she said, once they had been dating for about six months. <i>You should keep
your options open for a while. College is the chance to explore what you like, it’s not good to settle down right
away.</i></p>

<p><i>Mom, are you suggesting I sleep around?</i></p>

<p>She shut up pretty quickly after that.</p>

<p>Even Erica brought it up. Hanna had been making pancakes; it came out of nowhere.
<i>Han, I'm serious about you, but I wanted to say. Like. I know it's your first relationship and everything. And it's okay if you want to explore, or whatever.</i></p>

<p>Hanna laughed. <i>What would that even look like?</i></p>

<p><i>I don't know, we could try an open relationship or something.</i></p>

<p>Hanna flipped a pancake over and turned around to face her tiny girlfriend. She grabbed Erica's
arms and pulled her in, squeezing tight. <i>Eri, I don't want anyone else. I’m happy with you. It's okay.</i></p>

<p>She wonders now, looking at the barista's purple hair, if that was a mistake. It's true, she was
happy at the time. But that's because she didn’t know anyone or anything else. It had always been Erica, from the start.</p>

<br><hr><br>

<p>Hanna had been working on a painting for Erica's twenty-third birthday, around the same time
The Call happened. It was a rendition of the Chicago landscape, requested by Erica in an abstract
watercolor, But the colors kept bleeding into each other in ways that Hanna did not like, ways she
could not control. She was never very good at abstract art, although she had promised that she would
try, for Eri.</p>

<p>She never finished it.</p>

<p>"Can I take this for you?"</p>

<p>It's the purple-haired barista, and Hanna has finished her drink. She looks up, smiles, nods.</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>She takes her time, smoothing her shirt down, checking her phone. Erica should be getting
home soon, if she hasn't already. She'll Uber over, and then wait for Erica to open the door, and then she'll say that she needs to not see her for a long while, to go live somewhere else, to focus on art and figure out how to be a person again. And Erica will cry. That's the worst part—she'll be crying, and
there won't be anything Hanna can do about it, and the last thing she ever wanted to do was hurt her.
It will break her heart. It will break both of their hearts.</p>

<p>Then Hanna will fly back to Arizona, back to her empty apartment and half-finished paintings.
She will no longer have anyone to call at night, no longer have soft cotton-candy sweatshirts to hold
close. She will need a destination, something that is hers and hers alone. She does not know if it is
possible. But she looks at the couple and realizes that she cannot give that to Erica anytime soon, and it
is not fair to ask her to wait for something that may never come back.</p>

<p>It begins to snow, outside, Hanna watches flecks of white stick themselves to the window and
imagines the Chicago wind whipping across her face, sneaking its way into her bones. She shivers a
little, already longing for the lost warmth of her coffee. It's too late, now; her ride is here. She takes one
last look around the cafe: the purple hair, the twin cappuccinos, the cursive lettering.</p>

<p>The bells jingle lightly behind her as she leaves the cafe.</p>
